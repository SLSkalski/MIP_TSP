The goal of the TSP – to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the original city – is simple, but solving the problem is a complex and challenging endeavor. We’ll show you how to do it!\n",

        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous combinatorial optimization problems. This problem is very easy to explain, but very complicated to solve – even for instances with a small number of cities. More detailed information on the TSP can be found in the book The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study [1], or at the TSP home page [2]. If you are interested in the history and mathematical background of the TSP, we recommend that you watch the video by William Cook [3].\n",
        "\n",
        "The origin of the traveling salesman problem is not very clear; it is mentioned in an 1832 manual for traveling salesman, which included example tours of 45 German cities but was not formulated as a mathematical problem. However, in the 1800s, mathematicians William Rowan Hamilton and Thomas Kirkman devised mathematical formulations of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "It seems that the general form of the Traveling Salesman Problem was first studied by Karl Menger in Vienna and Harvard in the 1930s.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem became more and more popular in the 1950s and 1960s. In particular, George Dantzig, D. Ray Fulkerson, and Selmer M. Johnson at the RAND Corporation solved the 48-state problem by formulating it as a linear programming problem. The methods they described in their paper on this topic set the foundation for future work in combinatorial optimization, especially highlighting the importance of cutting planes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the early 1970s, the concept of P vs. NP problems created excitement in the theoretical computer science community. In 1972, Richard Karp demonstrated that the Hamiltonian cycle problem was NP-complete, implying that the traveling salesman problem was NP-hard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasingly sophisticated codes led to rapid increases in the sizes of the traveling salesman problems solved. Dantzig, Fulkerson, and Johnson had solved a 48-city instance of the problem in 1954. Martin Grötschel more than doubled this 23 years later, solving a 120-city instance in 1977. Harlan Crowder and Manfred W. Padberg again more than doubled this in just 3 years, with a 318-city solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1987, rapid improvements were made, culminating in a 2,392-city solution by Padberg and Giovanni Rinaldi. In the following two decades, great strides were made with David L. Applegate, Robert E. Bixby, Vasek Chvátal, & William J. Cook solving a 3,308-city instance in 1992, a 7,397-city instance in 1994, a 24,978-city instance in 2004, and an 85,900-city instance in 2006 – which is the largest 2-D Euclidean TSP instance ever solved. William Cook et. al. wrote a program called Concorde TSP Solver for solving the TSP [4]. Concorde is a computer code for the symmetric TSP and some related network optimization problems. The code is written in the ANSI C programming language and it has been used to obtain the optimal solutions to the full set of 110 TSPLIB instances, the largest instance is a 109,399 node 3-D “star” instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The continued interest in the TSP can be explained by its success as a general engine of discovery and a steady stream of new applications. Some of the general applications of the TSP are as follows:\n",
        "* Scheduling and routing problems.\n",
        "* Genome sequencing.\n",
        "* Drilling problems.\n",
        "* Aiming telescopes and x-rays.\n",
        "* Data clustering.\n",
        "* Machine scheduling.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use this classic combinatorial optimization problem to demonstrate how Gurobi can be used to easily and effectively solve small-sized problem instances of the TSP. However, in order to be able to solve larger instances, one needs more sophisticated techniques – such as those implemented in the Concord TSP Solver."

        "The TSP can be defined as follows: for a given list of cities and the distances between each pair of them, we want to find the shortest possible route that goes to each city once and returns to the origin city.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a class of Traveling Salesman Problems that assumes that the distance of going from city $i$ to city $j$  is the same as going form city $j$ to city $i$, this type of Traveling Salesman Problem  is also known as the symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem. In this example, we use Euclidean distances, but the TSP model formulation is valid independent of the way in which the individual distances are determined.\n",

The objective function coefficients for these variables are set to the calculated distances (`obj=dist`).\n",

            "    -   Degree constraints (`cons`) are added using `m.addConstrs()`. For each capital city `c`, this constraint ensures that the sum of the `vars` connected to `c` (using `vars.sum(c, '*')`) is exactly 2, meaning each city must have exactly two edges connected to it in the tour.\n",

A valid TSP \"tour\" must visit *every* city exactly once and return to the starting city, forming a single, large cycle. If the solution contains one or more smaller cycles (subtours) that don't encompass all cities, it's not a complete tour and therefore an invalid solution to the TSP. Subtour elimination is necessary to ensure that the optimization model finds a single, connected tour that includes all cities.\n",

Instead of adding all potential constraints at the beginning, lazy constraints are added *dynamically* during the optimization process. When the solver finds an integer feasible solution, it calls a user-defined callback function. This function checks if the solution violates any lazy constraints (in this case, subtour elimination constraints). If a violation is found (i.e., a subtour exists), the corresponding constraint is added to the model, and the solver continues. This process repeats until a solution is found that is feasible for all (explicit and lazy) constraints.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Reading Input Data:**\n",
            "    -   The state capital names and their geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) are loaded from a JSON file (`capitals.json`).\n",
            "    -   The code iterates through the loaded JSON data.\n",
            "    -   It filters out Alaska ('AK') and Hawaii ('HI') as this example focuses on the continental US capitals.\n",
            "    -   The capital names are stored in a list called `capitals`.\n",
            "    -   A dictionary called `coordinates` is created to store each capital's name as the key and a tuple of its latitude and longitude as the value.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Data Computation (Distance Calculation):**\n",
            "    -   A `distance` function is defined to calculate the Euclidean distance between two cities given their coordinates.\n",
            "    -   The `itertools.combinations` function is used to generate all unique pairs of cities from the `capitals` list. Since this is a symmetric TSP, the distance from city A to city B is the same as from city B to city A, so we only need to calculate each pair's distance once.\n",
            "    -   A dictionary called `dist` is created to store the calculated distances. The keys are tuples representing the city pairs `(city1, city2)`, and the values are the computed distances.\n",

These variables correspond to the city pairings (`dist.keys()`) and represent whether an edge exists between the cities in the optimal tour (`vtype=GRB.BINARY`). The objective function coefficients for these variables are set to the calculated distances (`obj=dist`).\n",
            "    -   To handle the symmetry constraint implicitly, the `vars` dictionary is updated so that accessing `vars[j, i]` returns the same variable as `vars[i, j]` for each pair `(i, j)`.\n",
            "    -   Degree constraints (`cons`) are added using `m.addConstrs()`. For each capital city `c`, this constraint ensures that the sum of the `vars` connected to `c` (using `vars.sum(c, '*')`) is exactly 2, meaning each city must have exactly two edges connected to it in the tour.\n",

A valid TSP \"tour\" must visit *every* city exactly once and return to the starting city, forming a single, large cycle. If the solution contains one or more smaller cycles (subtours) that don't encompass all cities, it's not a complete tour and therefore an invalid solution to the TSP. Subtour elimination is necessary to ensure that the optimization model finds a single, connected tour that includes all cities.\n",

            "**2. Subtour Elimination Constraints:**\n",
            "\n",

This prevents the formation of cycles that are smaller than the complete tour. The constraint formulation is:\n",

            "\n",
            "Gurobi's lazy constraints provide an efficient way to handle constraints that are only likely to be violated in the optimal or near-optimal solutions. Instead of adding all potential constraints at the beginning, lazy constraints are added *dynamically* during the optimization process. When the solver finds an integer feasible solution, it calls a user-defined callback function. This function checks if the solution violates any lazy constraints (in this case, subtour elimination constraints). If a violation is found (i.e., a subtour exists), the corresponding constraint is added to the model, and the solver continues. This process repeats until a solution is found that is feasible for all (explicit and lazy) constraints.\n",

            "- If the length of the found cycle (`tour`) is less than the total number of cities (`len(capitals)`), it means a subtour has been detected.\n",
            "- For each pair of cities `(i, j)` within the detected subtour, a lazy subtour elimination constraint is added to the model using `model.cbLazy()`. This constraint forces the number of selected edges within this specific subtour to be at most `len(tour) - 1`, thereby eliminating this subtour in future solutions.\n",
